## Introduction

Just my Neovim config if someone needs it or wants to make fun of it. I use vim-plug on an Arch Linux machine.

Also I use the following Coc Plugins:
- coc-pairs
- coc-pyright
- coc-clangd
- coc-snippets

(The theme that I personally use for Airline is 'minimalist', you can set your own theme using `:AirlineTheme [Theme]`)

## Considerations

There's some things you need to have in consideration before using this config.

- As i said in the introduction I used a machine with Arch Linux in it, normally you should have no problem with that.
- I used Neovim, **not** Vim. So if you use Vim you should rename this file to '.vimrc'.
- You need vim-plug before using this config, or it won't work.
- Autocorrect will only work with Python, C and C++. If you want to use it with another language you need to install the proper Coc plugin.
